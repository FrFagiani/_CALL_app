ORBIS;Augmenting participation, co-creation, trust and transparency in Deliberative Democracy at all scales;2023;;36;2023-2026;;Coordinator;Future;Horizon Europ;€2,843,922.00;€366,563.00;"ORBIS addresses the disconnects between ambitious ideas and collective actions at a large socio-technical scale. It responds to the profound lack of dialogue between citizenship and policy making institutions by providing a theoretically sound and highly 
pragmatic socio-technical solution to enable the transition to a more inclusive, transparent and trustful Deliberative Democracy in Europe. The project shapes and supports new democratic models that are developed through deliberative democracy processes; it follows a socio-constructive approach in which deliberative democracy is not a theory which prescribes new democratic practices and models, but rather the process through which we can collectively imagine and realize them. 
ORBIS provides new ways to understand and facilitate the emergence of new participatory democracy models, together with the mechanisms to scale them up and consolidate them at institutional level. It delivers: (i) a sound methodology for deliberative participation and co-creation at scale; (ii) novel AI-enhanced tools for deliberative participation across diverse settings; (iii) a novel socio-technical approach that augments the articulation between deliberative processes and representative institutions in liberal democracies; (iv) new evidence-based democratic models that emerge from the application of citizen deliberation processes; (v) demonstrated measurable impact of such innovations in real-world settings. 
The project builds on cutting-edge AI tools and technologies to develop a sustainable digital solution, and bridges theories and technological solutions from the fields of political and social science, social innovation, Artificial Intelligence, argumentation and digital democracy. The achievement of the project’s goal is validated through six use cases addressing contemporary issues at different scales and settings, experimenting with different civic participation and deliberation models, and involving diverse types of stakeholders.";;;Democratic engagement and civic participation, New participatory democracy models

CLIMABOROUGH;Building green and climate neutral city-hubs;2023;;48;2023-2027;;Partner;Future;Horizon Europ;€11,037,898.00;€368,750.00;CLIMABOROUGH is an Innovation project designed to field test the ClimHub, Climate Sandbox and Climate Service concepts within 12 European Cities engaged in their ecological and digital transition. The project aims to enhance traditional urban and spatial planning approaches through data and knowledge based decision making (including a possible new role for GIS - Geographic Information Systems), including climate services co-production for transitions, cross-city and cross-country pilot co-creation as well as the tactical use of public procurement of innovative solutions. The goal is not just to enhance an open set of tools leveraging climate transition in cities, but also to boost the exchange of experimental good practices, experiences and lessons learnt in this field, to help cities meet climate neutrality by 2050. This will be achieved by the following expected results: (A) building ClimHubs of Cities and solution providers to work on experimentations in real conditions, (B) harnessing the collective intelligence of local stakeholders for collaborative solution development, (C) defining Climate Services as a model strategy to use data and visualisation tools for climate transition, (D) field testing the Climate Sandbox concept as a way to prioritise and facilitate transformation of successfully deployed prototypes into established solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation in cities, and (E) monitoring and assessing the progress in achieving those goals and in implementing a climate neutrality planning scheme. Based on the lessons learnt and successful concept of the H2020 Designscapes CSA, CLIMABOROUGH has the ambition to bridge the gap between design and implementation of urban innovations, particularly in the domain of climate change adaptation and mitigation.;;;Urbanization and urban planning, cities, Nature-based solutions, Mobility, tourism, transportation and logistics, Greenhouse gases
MESOC;Measuring the social impacts of culture;02/2020;03/2023;36;2020-2023;;;Current;Horizon2020, RIA;€2,986,000.00;€385,250.00;MESOC is a Research and Innovation Action designed to propose, test and validate an innovative and original approach to measuring the societal value and impacts of culture and cultural policies and practices, related to three crossover themes of the new European Agenda for Culture: 1) Health and Wellbeing, 2) Urban and Territorial Renovation and 3) People’s Engagement and Participation. The global aim is to respond to the challenge posed by the H202 Call. To do so, MESOC adapts and further develops a method for “transition based” impact assessment derived from a previous UNESCO Chair publication, building a structural model of the Societal Dimension of Culture, as defined by one of the strategic objectives of the European Agenda.;https://www.mesoc-project.eu/.;Grazia Concilio, Ilaria Tosoni, Irene Bianchi, Anna Moro, Valeria Fedeli, Davide Ponzini;social impacts, urban sustainability transition, cultural initiatives

Bringing together immigrants, the public sector and private organisations, easyRights have developed solutions that provide personalised, context-aware information to its users, taking into account background, demographics and language skills. The tools support immigrants in their search for responses for different needs in a manner that saves time for both migrants and social service staff and cutting costs for the public administration.;https://www.easyrights.eu/.;Grazia Concilio, Maryam Karimi, Giuliana Costa, Paola Regina;Migrants integration, Public sector innovation, Mediation grammar

A suite of data processing and visualisation tools coupled with a structured and tailorable methodology for introducing open (geo) data into the policy-making lifecycle helps cities overcome barriers to big data use and enables them to leverage the benefits of data analytics to build stakeholder engagement.;https://policyvisuals.eu/;;

The focus is on applying design tools and methods, since this offers a systematic approach to conceive user-driven innovations. DESIGNSCAPES distributes direct financial support to flagship and innovation generating initiatives as well as a huge capacity building effort targeting\ multiple stakeholder groups (citizens, researchers, practitioners, innovators and policy makers). In doing so, the project will foster the linkages between research, policy and practice.;https://designscapes.eu/;;

OPEN4CITIZENS works to reduce such gap. It involves citizens into a co-design process (hackathons), together with IT experts, public administrations, interest groups and start-up companies, in order to develop new services to improve urban quality and certain aspects of their everyday life. The aim of the project is to raise citizens’ awareness about the opportunity offered by open data and create a new culture of innovation in public services. In each of the five pilot locations (Copenhagen, Karlstad, Rotterdam, Milano and Barcelona) the project will also create physical or virtual locations (OpenDataLab) that will become the reference point for all citizens and interest groups that want to propose innovative applications based on open data.;http://open4citizens.eu/.;;
